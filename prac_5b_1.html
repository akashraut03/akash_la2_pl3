      <strong>Computer science</strong> is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation
        itself.As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and
        information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software.
        Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns
        abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data structures have been
        called the heart of computer science.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <em>History of computer science</em>
    <hr>
    The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer.
    Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as
    multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the
    development of sophisticated computing equipment.
    Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623.In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital
    mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner.Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons,
    documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first
    calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first<em> automatic mechanical
    calculator</em>, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.

  <h3>Programming language theory</h3>
  <p>
    Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, 
    analysis, characterization, and classification 
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>and their individual features. 
    It falls within the discipline of computer science, 
    both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, 
    and linguistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

    <strong>Functional programming</strong>, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Imperative programming</strong>, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

    <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong>,a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Service-oriented programming</strong>, a programming paradigm that uses "services" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programs.
